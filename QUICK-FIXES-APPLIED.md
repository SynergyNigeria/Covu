## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Product Detail → Purchase Navigation**

**File:** `frontend/assets/js/product-detail.js`

**Issue:** Buy Now button was redirecting to `orders.html` instead of `purchase.html`

**Changes:**

- ✅ Line 309: Changed `window.location.href = 'orders.html'` to `'purchase.html'`
- ✅ Line 307: Changed localStorage key from `'purchaseProduct'` to `'selectedProduct'` to match purchase.js expectations

**Impact:** Users can now properly navigate from product detail to purchase page when clicking "Buy Now"

---

### 2. **Fixed Profile Page Hardcoded Values**

**File:** `frontend/templates/profile.html`

**Issue:** Wallet, Orders, and Rating showing hardcoded values (₦25K, 12, 4.8)

**Changes:**

- ✅ Added `id="walletBalance"` to wallet div (was showing ₦25K)
- ✅ Added `id="orderCount"` to orders div (was showing 12)
- ✅ Added `id="storeRating"` to rating div (was showing 4.8)
- ✅ Set initial values to 0 instead of hardcoded numbers

**File:** `frontend/assets/js/profile.js`

**Changes:**

- ✅ Updated `updateQuickStats()` function to populate these IDs with real backend data
- ✅ Wallet balance now shows from `user.wallet_balance`
- ✅ Order count now shows from `userOrders.length`
- ✅ Rating shows 0.0 (placeholder until we implement rating fetch)

**Impact:** Profile page now shows real-time data from backend API

---

## 📊 Current Status

### **Order Flow:**

```
✅ Product Detail → Buy Now → Purchase Page (FIXED!)
⏳ Purchase Page → Create Order → Backend API (Next step)
⏳ Orders Page → View/Manage Orders (Next step)
```

### **Profile Page:**

```
✅ Wallet Balance - Shows real balance from backend
✅ Order Count - Shows actual number of orders
✅ Rating - Shows 0.0 (will update when ratings implemented)
✅ User Info - Shows from backend (name, email, phone)
✅ Shop Status - Shows active shop or "no shop"
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Phase 3A: Order Creation** (Ready to implement)

2. Update purchase.js to call backend API
3. Test order creation with escrow

### **Phase 3B: Order Management** (Ready to implement)

1. Update orders.js to fetch from backend
2. Update status mapping (PENDING → ACCEPTED → DELIVERED → CONFIRMED)
3. Add cancel/confirm actions with API calls
