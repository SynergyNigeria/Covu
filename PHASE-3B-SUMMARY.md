# Phase 3B: Order Management - Quick Summary ✅

## What Was Changed

### `frontend/assets/js/orders.js`

1. **`loadOrders()`** - Fetch from backend

   - Changed from localStorage to `api.get(API_CONFIG.ENDPOINTS.ORDERS)`
   - Added authentication check
   - Added loading spinner
   - Added error handling with retry button

2. **`displayOrders()`** - Sort by backend field

   - Changed `order.orderDate` → `order.created_at`
   - Removed sample order creation

3. **`createOrderCard()`** - Map backend fields

   - `order.productName` → `order.product.name`
   - `order.productImage` → `order.product.images`
   - `order.storeName` → `order.product.store_name`
   - `order.total` → `order.total_amount`
   - `order.id` → `order.order_number` (for display)
   - `order.orderDate` → `order.created_at`

4. **`getStatusInfo()`** - Backend status mapping

   - Changed from lowercase to UPPERCASE status keys
   - `'pending'` → `'PENDING'` (Cancel button)
   - `'confirmed'` → `'ACCEPTED'` (No button)
   - Added `'DELIVERED'` (Confirm Receipt button)
   - `'delivered'` → `'CONFIRMED'` (Completed, no button)
   - `'cancelled'` → `'CANCELLED'` (No button)

5. **`handleOrderAction()`** - API calls

   - Changed from localStorage to async API calls
   - Cancel: `POST /api/orders/{id}/cancel/`
   - Confirm: `POST /api/orders/{id}/confirm/`
   - Reload orders after action

6. **Removed `createSampleOrders()`** - No longer needed

## How It Works Now

### User Flow

1. Login → Navigate to Orders page
2. Page fetches orders from `GET /api/orders/`
3. User sees their orders with real status
4. User can:
   - **Cancel** PENDING orders (wallet refunded)
   - **Confirm Receipt** of DELIVERED orders (escrow released)

### Status Lifecycle

```
CREATE → [PENDING] → Cancel → [CANCELLED] ✅ Refund
            ↓
         Accept (Seller)
            ↓
        [ACCEPTED]
            ↓
      Mark Delivered (Seller)
            ↓
       [DELIVERED] → Confirm (Buyer) → [CONFIRMED] ✅ Escrow Released
```

## Testing

### Quick Test Steps

1. ✅ Create an order (purchase.html)
2. ✅ View it on orders page (should show PENDING)
3. ✅ Cancel it (should show CANCELLED, wallet refunded)
4. ✅ Create another order
5. ✅ Have seller mark it DELIVERED (via backend/admin)
6. ✅ Confirm receipt (should show CONFIRMED, seller gets paid)

### Backend Commands

```bash
# View orders
GET /api/orders/

# Check wallet balance
GET /api/wallet/balance/

# Check transactions
GET /api/wallet/transactions/
```
